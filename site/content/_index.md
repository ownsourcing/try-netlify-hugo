  Some quests for knowledge are difficult and dangerous. Sometimes you just
  click.

  heading: Why Ariadne?
  text: >-
    Complex challenges don't always require deep expertise. Ariadne is a project
    accelerator that considers how you work with a team, what new skills build
    on your strengths, and how groups best collaborate. You can explore paths
    others have built to the destinations you want. Take risks. Run down those
    paths. Choose to fail quickly and iterate on improvements. As you discover
    successes and failures, turn them into a plan in which you can be focused an
    confident. Add the team members you need. Take on the tasks that match your
    strengths.
intro:
  heading: What's the boss's role? What's the client's role?
  text: >-
    Few people work in isolation. Colleagues, bosses and clients all play key
    roles. Finishing a project successfully means working effectively with this
    range of people.

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
